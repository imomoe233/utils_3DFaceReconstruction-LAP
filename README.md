## Introduction
This repository contains LAP (Learning to Aggregate and Personalize) framework for reconstructing 3D face. Right now we provide a version of demo for testing on in-the-wild images. The output size is 128 and the model is finetuned on CelebAMask-HQ Dataset.

## Requirments
The code is tested on pytorch 1.3.0 with torchvision 0.4.1
```
pip install torch==1.3.0
pip install torchvision==0.4.1
```

[Neural renderer](https://github.com/daniilidis-group/neural_renderer.git) is needed to render the reconstructed images or videos
```
pip install neural_renderer_pytorch
```

It may fail if you have a GCC version below 5. If you do not want to upgrade your GCC, one alternative solution is to use conda's GCC and compile the package from source. For example:
```
conda install gxx_linux-64=7.3
git clone https://github.com/daniilidis-group/neural_renderer.git
cd neural_renderer
python setup.py install
```

[Facenet](https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch) is also needed to detect and crop human faces in images.
```
pip install facenet-pytorch
```

## DEMO
Download the [pretrained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Lr9V7T3G5xn1WAfR0F5Mh_rKRgdVs88/view?usp=sharing), and then run:

```
python demo.py --input E:/code_xwd/dataset/Face_Forgery_Detection/test --result E:/code_xwd/dataset/Face_Forgery_Detection/test_lap --checkpoint_lap ./demo/checkpoint300.pth

python demo.py --input E:/code_xwd/dataset/Face_Forgery_Detection/train --result E:/code_xwd/dataset/Face_Forgery_Detection/train_lap --checkpoint_lap ./demo/checkpoint300.pth

python demo.py --input ./images --result ./results --checkpoint_lap ./demo/checkpoint300.pth
```

Options:

--gpu: enable gpu

--detect_human_face: enable automatic human face detection and cropping using MTCNN provided in facenet-pytorch

--render_video: render 3D animations using neural_renderer (GPU is required)

## Note:
The output depth is transformed by several options and functions, including tanh(), depth_rescaler and depth_inv_rescaler for better visualization. You could search along these options to find the original output depth and rescale it to a required range.
The defined direction of normal in normal maps may be different to your required setting.
If you want to accelarate the inference procedure, you may delete the branches irrelavant to reconstruct depth, and set anti_aliasing=False in each renderer.
